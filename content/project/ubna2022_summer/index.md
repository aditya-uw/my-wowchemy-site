## Description:

I worked under my principal investigator, Dr. Wu-Jung Lee, to conduct a passive acoustic bat monitoring project. My colleague, Josie Sachen, and I deployed 6 Audiomoth recorders at 6 different locations at the Union Bay Natural Area near the UW's football stadium and the E-18 parking lot.

Our intention was to collect acoustic activity of echolocating bats over the Summer season when bat activity rises with the increase of insect presence. We could use this activity to develop computational bat call detectors and understand how to build a long-term PAM project for studying the use of echolocation in navigation and foraging in bats.

We collected acoustic activity from June to October 2022 with certain Audiomoth configurations:
- Sampling rate: 192000 Hz 
- Recording schedule: 00:00 to 24:00 UTC
- Record/Sleep Cycle: 1795 seconds on / 5 seconds off

## Acknowledgements

- I want to thank my colleague Josie Sachen for helping us with this project. We had to work 2-3 times a week for 4 hours during Seattle heat waves and all and I'm thankful for her support.
- I also want to thank the Applied Physics Laboratories for the funding they provided me towards this project.
- I finally want to acknowledge my principal investigator Wu-Jung Lee for her patience and guidance in performing fieldwork and running analysis on collected acoustic data.
